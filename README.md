===========

Localtunnel v2 (Beta)  Localtunnel lets you expose a local web server to the public Internet.  For example, running a web server on port 8000 on your laptop can be made public with::  $ localtunnel-beta 8000   Port 8000 is now accessible from http://8fde2c.v2.localtunnel.com ...  The localtunnel server is provided as a free public service. However, you can also deploy your own localtunnel server on dotCloud or your own server. Installing  Localtunnel currently requires Python 2.6 or greater. Install with pip::  $ pip install localtunnel
